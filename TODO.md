The collapsed bar could also work as a notification bar if like your target is up next, or your target has self hosped, or upon calling your planned target is under called status or over 15 mins

maahly you could also directly take the user to their target's attack page when they click on their name instead of take them to their profile. saves those few seconds if they are online

UI to change MIN and MAX FF.

1) if someone comes online (hosped or not) could you shift them to the top of the list? useful for chain watchers

2) when i click on the players tab can you redirect it to their attack page rather than their profile? that will stop them from flying away
