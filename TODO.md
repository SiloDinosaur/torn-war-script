- The collapsed bar could also work as a notification bar if like your target is up next, or your target has self hosped, or upon calling your planned target is under called status or over 15 mins
- Ability to "recall" your targets. If it's already yours, add a "Recall" button to send "<targetname> recall" into the chat
- Make the script work without "in", so "<targetName> <numberOfMinutes>" should make a target called too
- If message starts like "<targetname> in <minutes>", handle it (e.g. "slenky in 5 if not called before")
